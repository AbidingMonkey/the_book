# The Book

This was my attempt at a short story. It's nothing much. It's a slice of life little story.

## Methods

The goal of this project and subsequent projects was to use open source tools to write a screenplay. No help from other softwares. 

For this project, the following tools were used:

- The original, rough draft was written using [Story Architect](https://starc.app)

- The subsewuent drafts and revisions were written in [VS Codium](https://vscodium.com/) using the  [Better Fountain](https://github.com/piersdeseilligny/betterfountain) plugin.
